# Exercise2: GitHub Command line interface (CLI)

## Purpose

This is the second exercise for the professional python course. The purpose is to build a proper CLI using the github API.
The task is (copied from the professional python course): 

Create a python program to interact with GitHub and retrieve data.
Add the following commands:

- Count all stars of all repos of yourself, a specified user or an organization.
- Print out details about yourself, a user or organization.
  Allow a nicely printed format as default and offer output as json too.
- One of the following:
  - (easy) Modify your user description by adding a tea emoji and a heart.
  - (difficult) Set your user status (top-right when clicking on username)
    to a tea emoji with the message "Drinking Tea".

Focus points:

- End-users will use your program so focus on usability
- Integrate previous lessons as much as it makes sense
